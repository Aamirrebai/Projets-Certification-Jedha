## Goals

As the project has just started, your team doesn't have any data that can be used to create this application. Therefore, your job will be to: 

* Scrape data from destinations 
* Get weather data from each destination 
* Get hotels' info about each destination
* Store all the information above in a data lake
* Extract, transform and load cleaned data from your datalake to a data warehouse
